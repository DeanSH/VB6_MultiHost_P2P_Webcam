# VB6_MultiHost_P2P_Webcam
P2P MultiHost Webcam Streaming allowing the user to stream a Webcam to Multiple Viewers, manage Viewers, Quality and Compression control and compiled testing exe with usage example utilising a config loading file. Originally developed toward my YippyChat messenger project.

# NOTE:
There is 3 VB6 projects here, 1 for the Webcam Hosting, another for Webcam Viewing, and lastly an Example of how to user them programatically to setup the config file before running either the Host or View cam exe's to make them work correctly.

# Important
Place the vic32.dll file in your system32, and additionally SysWOW64 for 64bit Windows, 
then right click and run the Register vic32 batch file as administrator to register it!
Use Example.exe to start using the Webcam Host or Viewing exe's 
it sets up the config file prior to running the View or Host Cam exe's.
If any other DLL/OCX errors occur then use the all needed files + reg for my VB6 projects.
